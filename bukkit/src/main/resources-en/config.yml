# Encryption settings
encryption-settings:
  # Whether to enable encryption
  # When encryption is enabled, the password in data.yml must be specified in an already encrypted format and in a separate field encrypted-pass:
  # To see what the password will look like in encrypted form, you can use the command /usp encrypt <password>
  # However, if the auto-encrypt-passwords option is enabled, you can specify a regular password in the old pass: format in data.yml, and the plugin will automatically convert it.
  enable-encryption: false
  # Password encryption method (Supported types: BASE64, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512, SHA3-224, SHA3-256, SHA3-384, SHA3-512)
  # BASE64 - This "encryption" does not provide data protection; it is simply a method of converting data to another format for network transmission or storage.
  # Use BASE64 only if you're afraid of "accidentally showing the file with passwords on the demo" and you don't need to specifically hide the data or to make encryption more complicated
  # SHA256 and other SHA - variations of the SHA algorithm.
  # Use SHA256 if you want to securely hide passwords without the possibility of decryption, and SHA512 for even more effective encryption
  # SHA3-256 and other SHA3 - an analogue of the usual SHA with a modified encryption algorithm.
  # Use SHA3 if you want to make non-standard and at the same time strong encryption
  # You can use 2 or more encryption methods simultaneously for greater security of your passwords, so they cannot be easily brute-forced
  # Encryption will be performed in order 1;2;3 and so on. It's important - deep encryption can take a lot of time, so don't use too many of them
  # SALT is used to apply salt (random string to an existing password). You can only apply it once.
